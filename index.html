					CurOn is a therapy on demand mobile app that offers coaching and therapy sessions 24/7. CurOn provides six types of therapy, these being: coaching, mindfulness based cognitive therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, compassion focused therapy, culturally sensitive therapy, and solution focused brief therapy. The purpose of this service is to make therapy accessible and affordable to all. Curon uses artificial intelligence technology to learn from real therapists in order to provide a safe place for users to learn, talk, and chat. Curon focuses on using natural language by processing and determining direct responses to simulate conversation, remember past sessions, and deliver informed advice on mental health. Curon uses computer language techniques to learn from informative conversations that previously occurred and to provide therapeutic encounters that are psychologically related, responsive to a person’s state of health and utilizing tools from cognitive, behavioral, and interpersonal disciplines.

        <div>
            <p>
                In the early years, people believed that only humans' physical bodies could become ill but not their minds. Mental illnesses were not acknowledged as a disorder but rather related to spirituality. Nowadays, although there is still a stigma around this topic, mental illness is no longer seen as something from the supernatural world and more awareness has been raised around this topic day by day.

                Galen and Hippocrates explore the link between mental state and medicine, rejecting beliefs that medical conditions stemmed from supernatural influences.

                Paracelsus (1493-1541), was one of the few physicians to advocated for the use of psychotherapy. He called for the humane treatment of the mentally ill (but was ignored for several centuries). He did not see them as possessed by evil spirits, but merely 'brothers' ensnared in a treat able malady."

                Austrian physician Franz Anton Mesmer (1734-1815), treated patients by using hypnosis and received some of the earliest recognition as a founder of psychotherapy. Around the same time, French physician Philippe Pinel (1745–1826) was credited with founding the field of psychiatry.

    Having a programmed therapist that can understand people’s emotions and help them out with solving their problems on a regular basis would be a great start to a better world. Collaborating with a group member that has the same goal to better people’s mental health, Sakina partnered up with Ivete. Together we created a mobile application that helps anyone looking for an affordable therapist that can positively affect their daily life.
