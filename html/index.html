            Curon is a therapy-on-demand mobile app that offers affordable
            coaching and therapy sessions 24/7. Curon focuses on using natural
            language by processing and determining direct responses to simulate
            conversation, remember past sessions, and deliver informed advice on
            mental health. Curon uses computer language techniques to learn from
            informative conversations that previously occurred and to provide
            therapeutic encounters that are psychologically related, responsive
            to a person’s state of health, and utilizing tools from cognitive,
            behavioral, and interpersonal disciplines. Curon exists to make
            therapy accessible and affordable to all.

          <p class="timelinedescription">
            In the early years, people believed that only humans' physical
            bodies could become ill but not their minds. Mental illnesses were
            not acknowledged as a disorder but rather related to spirituality.
            Nowadays, although there is still a stigma around this topic, mental
            illness is no longer seen as something from the supernatural world
            and more awareness has been raised around this topic day by day.

              <p>
                Sakina is a graduate of San Jose State University in 2023 as a
                UI/UX designer. Sakina has always been interested in how
                technology can affect human health to make them feel good. As
                the years progressed and she experienced a lot of mental health
                issues because of the pandemic in her family life she started to
                focus on how there can be a friend to help those who are going
                through similar problems. Having a programmed therapist that can
                understand people’s emotions and help them out with solving
                their problems on a regular basis would be a great start to a
                better world. Collaborating with a group member that has the
                same goal to better people’s mental health, Sakina partnered up
                with Ivete. Together we created a mobile application that helps
                anyone looking for an affordable therapist that can positively
                affect their daily life. Sakina is another creator of the CURON
                App which has launched in 2025.
